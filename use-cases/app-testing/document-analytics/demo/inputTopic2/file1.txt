A fifth Premier League trophy lift in six years followed Manchester Cityâ€™s 1-0 victory over Chelsea on Sunday afternoon, 
as the champions closed out their home campaign in a party atmosphere. 

Challengers Arsenal lost at Nottingham Forest a day earlier, as part of a late-season collapse which has seen the Gunners 
win just one of their last seven outings. It meant that City officially clinched the title with three games left to play.
